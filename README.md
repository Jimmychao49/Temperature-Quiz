# Temperature-Quiz
For my first Programming assignment at Leiden University, I had to write a simple program in C++ that determines if someone is suitable for a beta-study or not.

The program starts with asking the age of the user. Here are a few parameters that will stop the program, such as if the age is over 100 or under 10. After determining the age the program will ask the user to convert a random generated temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit and back. If the user got one or more questions correct, the user is suitable for a beta-study and the program will stop. Else the program will ask a multiple choice question in the art field. If the user answers correctly, the user is suitable for an alpha study and the program will stop. If neither of these apply the program determines that the user is unfit for a study and will close.

# Restrictions
As this was the very first programming Assignment, use of more advanced and efficient techniques were explicitly prohibited. No use of arrays or strings were allowed, as well as any kind of loop. This of course results in a program that has far more code than it in reality requires.

# Grade
After the project was turned in it got graded with a 8.5 :)
